In this picture we have walls of different heights. This picture is represented by an array of integers, where
the value at each index is the height of the wall. The picture above is represented with an array as
[2,5,1,2,3,4,7,7,6].
Now imagine it rains. How much water is going to be accumulated in puddles between walls?
